            Hi, my name is Sahil, and I'm a Computer Science student at the
            University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have a passion for
            building innovative software solutions and exploring the latest
            technologies. From developing full-stack applications that bring my
            ideas to life to prototyping intelligent AI systems that solve
            meaningful problems, Iâ€™m constantly driven by the desire to build
            and experiment. I chose Computer Science because it's an
            ever-evolving field that allows me to combine my creativity with
            technology to create anything I put my mind to.
